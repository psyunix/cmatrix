# This GitHub Actions workflow builds and pushes a Docker image to Docker Hub.
# It uses the latest Alpine image as the base image and installs cmatrix.
# The Dockerfile is assumed to be in the root of the repository.
# The workflow triggers on pushes to the main branch.
# Make sure to set up your Docker Hub credentials in the GitHub repository secrets:
# DOCKER_USERNAME and DOCKER_PASSWORD.
# You can also customize the Docker image name and tag as needed.
